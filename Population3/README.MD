# Population 3

Population3 is a C# game project using MonoGame that simulates the early universe with gas grids, particle systems, and procedural generation. Inspired by astrophysics and a touch of sci-fi flair, this project is part of the Population series, exploring the evolution of dark matter entities and cosmic phenomena. 🚀

# ToDos

-Get The Gas To Collapse and form a star

-Give the Stars a shader
-Give the Gas a shader
-Move Simulation to GPU

# Issues

-Simulation looks ok but does not scale too well

# Background
Your project "Population 0, Das Leben der Rah" revolves around a unique species called the Rah, which exist as dark matter and influence the universe through physical fields. They are the explanation for dark matter. Their evolutionary journey spans several stages:

Population III: The Rah initially manipulate stars, influencing them through their own gravity.
Population 0: At this stage, they progress to biological integration and the creation of megastructures.
Key Concepts
Physics Breakthroughs: The Rah’s abilities break from known physics, particularly in areas like gravity manipulation, electromagnetic control, and information processing.
Extension of the Standard Model: Your idea explores a hypothetical expansion of physics, incorporating dark matter as an active participant rather than a passive element.
